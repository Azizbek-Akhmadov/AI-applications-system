#AI-applications-system

All weekly tasks have been updated and included in the MidTerm file. I wrote an explanation for each line of code.



#Week 2

https://github.com/Azizbek-Akhmadov/Mid-term-exam-AI-applications-system/blob/main/AI_application_week_2.ipynb

In this week we learned about:

• Get Started with Google Colab
• Uploading data
• Importing Kaggle’s dataset
• Basic File Operations 

#Week 3

https://github.com/Azizbek-Akhmadov/Mid-term-exam-AI-applications-system/blob/main/AI_application_week_3.ipynb

In this week we larned about Instructions for pushing our code to a remote GitHub repository

WIth followig commands:

cd project_folder
git checkout local-branch-name
git init
gitignore // git rm -r --cached (Optional)
git add .
git commit -m "ver1"
git remote set-url origin https://ghp_key@github.com/-----/smsl-project.git
//git push origin remote branch
git push origin master
// git push origin main

#Week 4

https://github.com/Azizbek-Akhmadov/Mid-term-exam-AI-applications-system/blob/main/AI_application_week_4.ipynb

This is a four week assignment. So I learned how to get her CSV file using a link from Git Hub. It also displays
CPU information. If you have a GPU, install your GPU. In general, you learned how to get data from various
sources. Kaggle, Google Drive, Git Hub, etc. I tried to get mnist csv from kaggle. 

Also in this week we learned about fully connected networks:
-Introduction to Datasets used when training networks
– Extending the network and learning algorithm to do
multiclass classification
– Network for Digit Classification
– Loss Function for Multiclass Classification
– Programming Example: Classifying handwritten Digits
– Mini-Batch gradient descent

#Week 5

In this week we mostly learned about TensorFlow
• What is Tensorflow
• Computational graph
• Variables, Constants and Placeholders in TensorFlow
• Tensorboard visualization
• tf.summary.scalar command
• tf.summary.histogram command

https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/

#Week 6

Here is the contents that we've covered in this week:

•Linear Regression using TensorFlow
• Visualization of Linear Regression parameters using
TensorFlow
• Digit Classification | Neural network to classify MNIST
dataset using TensorFlow

#Week 7

https://github.com/Azizbek-Akhmadov/Mid-term-exam-AI-applications-system/blob/main/Ai_application_week_7.ipynb

In this week we mostly learned about Convolutional Neural Networks Applied to
Image Classification

Convolutional Neural Networks
• The CIFAR-10 Dataset
• Characteristics and building blocks for convolutional
layers
• Combining feature maps into a convolutional layer
• Combining convolutional and fully connected layers into a
network
• Effects of sparse connections and weight sharing
• Image classification with a convolutional network

#Week 9

https://github.com/Azizbek-Akhmadov/AI-applications-system/blob/main/AI_application_week9_1_.ipynb

Keras datasets listURL
https://keras.io/api/datasets/

In this week we mostly worked with "Fully Connected Networks Applied to
Regression"

Contents:
Logistic unit for binary classification
Softmax unit for multiclass classification
Linear unit for regression
The Boston Housing dataset
Predicting house prices with a DNN
Improving generalization with regularization
Experiment: Deeper and regularized models for house
price prediction
Concluding remarks on output units and regression
problems

#Week 10 

https://github.com/Azizbek-Akhmadov/AI-applications-system/blob/main/AI_application_week_10.ipynb

Deeper CNNs and Pretrained Models

Contents:
VGGNet
GoogLeNet
ResNet
Transfer Learning
Data Augmentation as a Regularization Technique
Mistakesmade by CNNs
Reducing parameters with Depthwise Separable
Convolution
Striking the right network design balance with
EfficientNet

Week 11
https://github.com/Azizbek-Akhmadov/AI-applications-system/blob/main/AI_application_week11.ipynb

In this week we worked with BOOKSTORE SALES DATA FROM US CENSUS BUREAU

Sales data from the United States Census Bureau can be obtained from https://www.census.gov/econ/currentdata.

Select Monthly Retail Trade and Food Services and click the Submit button. That should take you to a page where you need to specify five steps. Select:

Monthly Retail Trade and Food Services
Start: 1992 End: 2020
451211: Book Stores
Sales - Monthly
U.S. Total
Make sure that the checkbox Not Seasonally Adjusted is checked. Then click the GET DATA button.

 That should result in a table with data values. Download it to a comma-separated values (CSV) file by clicking the link TXT. Remove the first few lines in the downloaded CSV file, so the file starts with a single line containing headings saying "Period,Value" followed by one line for each month. Further, remove any lines with non-numerical values, such as "NA", at the end of the file. Name the file book_store_sales.csv and copy it to the data directory.
